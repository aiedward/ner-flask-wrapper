# Neural Networks for Named Entity Recognition

In this repo is a wrap over neural network architectures for named entity
recognition from the paper "_Application of a Hybrid Bi-LSTM-CRF model to the
task of Russian Named Entity Recognition_"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09686.pdf, which is inspired by LSTM+CRF
architecture from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01360.pdf.

NER class from ner/network.py provides methods for construction, training and
inference neural networks for Named Entity Recognition.
