# Flask wrapper for Named Entity Recognition

In this repo is a [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) wrapper over neural network
architectures for named entity recognition (NER) from the paper "_Application
of a Hybrid Bi-LSTM-CRF model to the task of Russian Named Entity Recognition_"
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09686.pdf, which is inspired by LSTM+CRF
architecture from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01360.pdf.

[Original](https://github.com/deepmipt/ner) repository.

### Usage

#### Installing

Install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and start server as follows:
